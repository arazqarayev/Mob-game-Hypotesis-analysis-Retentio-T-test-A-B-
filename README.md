📌 1. Libraries You Used

i used four main Python libraries:

1. NumPy

For numerical operations

Helps handle arrays and statistical calculations

2. Pandas

To load the dataset

To clean data and filter rows

To explore columns such as version, sum_gamerounds, retention_1, retention_7

3. Seaborn

For visualization (if needed)

Helps create charts

4. Matplotlib

Basic plotting and visual analysis

5. SciPy (stats module)

Used to perform the T-test

Helps compare the average gamerounds between two groups (gate_30 vs gate_40)

6. Statsmodels (proportion tests)

Used to perform the Z-test for proportions

Helps compare retention rates between the two groups

📌 2. Main Analyses You Performed
A. T-Test (Comparison of average game rounds)

You tested whether players in the new version played more or fewer game rounds compared to the old version.

B. 7-Day Retention Z-Test

You tested whether the percentage of returning players after 7 days is different between the two versions.

C. Group Comparison

You compared the average gamerounds of each version to see which performed better.

📌 3. Purpose of the Analysis

The goal was to answer two questions:

Does the new version increase engagement?
(Measured with sum_gamerounds)

Does the new version improve retention?
(Measured with retention_7)
